## Tracks We Applied For

### Discovery with Fleek Track

#### Fleek Edge Function Integration

We integrated Fleek Edge Functions to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our service. The endpoint:

```bash
https://fleek-test.network/services/1/ipfs/bafkreieyba4qsgo5mfj7mvmk3t6ge7gho27dep6vrtdpwn6545qgjmeecy/api/getGithubUserInfo?username=${username}
```

This integration allows us to pass any GitHub username and fetch relevant information fully hosted on Fleek Edge Function.

### Privy Integration

We leveraged Privy for seamless smart account-based transactions and paymaster-sponsored gas fee transactions for on-chain attestations. This integration ensures secure and hassle-free handling of blockchain transactions, enhancing the user experience.

### Attestations on EAS

We utilized Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for robust and verifiable attestations. This ensures that the contributions are authenticated and securely recorded on the blockchain.

## Additional Integrations

- **Bundlers and Paymasters**: Used to manage, ease and optimize the transaction process, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficiency with seamlessness for the end user.
- **Verifications through Attestations**: Ensures the credibility and accuracy of the recorded contributions, enhancing trust and reliability.
